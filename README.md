# Quantify

This is full-stack web application that leverages a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM model) to forecast future stock prices.
While it is difficult to forecast stock prices in order to earn arbitrage returns, this project was created so that I could learn some of the basics of machine learning.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Django
- JavaScript
- Vue.js
- Keras
- Tensorflow

## Set-up

### Front-end

1. Change into the `quantify-ui` directory and install dependencies.

```
cd quantify-ui
```

```
npm install
```

2. Run the front-end application on **Google Chrome**.

```
npm run dev
```

### Back-end

1. Create a virtual environment to run the Django application in.

```
py -m venv stockPredictorEnv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment.

```
stockPredictorEnv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Use the terminal you activated the virtual environment, run the Django application.

```
cd stock_forecaster
```

```
py manage.py runserver
```
